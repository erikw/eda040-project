# EDA040 camera project
 
Project in the course EDA040 at Lund University.

## User guide
Once you have installed the client application and deployed the server
on a camera you can start the application and connect to a camera by
long tapping on a frame and choose which camera to connect to. If you
are using a proxy or the fake camera, use the IP-address at the bottom
of the list. (NOTE: You can only display one camera if using proxy or
fake camera.)

To close a connection, simply long tap on the image from that camera and
choose Yes on the dialog that comes up.

By default, the cameras use idle mode, which displays one picture every
five second. If any of the connected cameras detect motion in the picture, all of
them will enter video mode displaying a continuously stream of images.

The current mode is displayed in the lower part of each frame with a V
for video mode and nothing for idle mode. This is where the delay
between the capturing and displaying of the image is displayed (Note:
This relies on the clock in both your device and the camera which means
that it will only be as correct as they are.)

When the cameras enter video mode, the triggering camera will display
[T] in the same area, letting you know which of them forced the other
into video mode.

For debug purposes, there are extra buttons available when pressing the
menu button on your Android device for forcing the cameras to enter
video or idle mode.

## Problems experienced
We can't say that we have experienced that many problems, except with LJRT.
Mostly, the development has been smooth. We have had several problems with
Eduroam, specifically with the lack of open ports making it impossible to test the
app on a physical device.

Also, the LJRT library has carried with it some problems. Mostly some implementation
details which differ between that and Java.


## How to build and run
	$ git clone git://github.com/Meldanya/eda040_project.git
	$ wget http://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r15-linux.tgz
	$ tar xvzf android-sdk_r15-linux.tgz
	$ PATH=$PATH:"`pwd`/android-sdk-linux/tools"
	$ echo "sdk.dir = ../../android-sdk-linux/" > eda040_project/Client/local.properties
	$ cd eda040_project

Beware! You have to redo the third last command if you switch shell.
### Server
Server should be started before trying to connect with client....

	$ cd Server

#### Cross compiled
Make sure you did not execute the commands in `Proxy server` below.

	$ echo 'CAMERAPASSWORD' > password.local
	$ ./compile2c.sh argus-X argus-Y < password.local

Enjoy, ice cold.

#### Proxy server
	$vi src/ImageCapture.java

Change to:

	import se.lth.cs.cameraproxy.Axis211A;
	import se.lth.cs.cameraproxy.MotionDetector;
	// import se.lth.cs.camera.Axis211A;
	// import se.lth.cs.camera.MotionDetector;

	// Real and fake.
	// this.camera = new Axis211A(); 
	// this.motionDetector = new MotionDetector();

	// Proxy.
	this.camera = new Axis211A("argus-4", 8080); // Proxycamera.
	this.motionDetector = new MotionDetector("argus-4", 8080); // Proxycamera

Because we're now using modern `Java`, exceptions must be caught.

	$ $EDITOR src/CameraServer.java

In `run()`, change to:

	try {
		socket.close();
	} catch (IOException e) {
		System.err.println("cold not close connection");
	}	

The files we move in this step is only needed as mock placeholders for
the C-crosscompiler.

	$ mv src/se /tmp

Now you can compile the junk:

	$ ant

Open a new shell and run the following:

	$ telnet argus-4
	telnet> /etc/CameraProxy 8080

Now return to the previous shell. It's time for execution! (not the lethal one):

	$ java -cp bin:lib/* CameraServer

### Client
	$ cd Client

#### Emulator
	$ android create avd -n api_10 -t target-10
	$ emulator -avd api_10 &

Wait until emulator is started and Android OS i up an running. Then compile, upload and watch the lolcat.

	$ ant debug
	$ ant installd
	$ adb lolcat

If the program should freeze at any point, run the following:

	$ ddms &

And find the process `se.lth.student.eda040.a1` in the upper left frame
and press the stop button.

Start the application	

##### Proxy
Choose proxy-camera.

##### Direct connection
Choose a real camera.
	
#### Real phone
Connect the phone to your computer.

	$ ant debug
	$ ant installd
	$ adb lolcat

Start the application	
Choose a real camera.

## Implementation Details

The sync feature is implemented but not currently used by our application. This is due to it requires synced timestamps on all systems, including the Emulator. This is not an issue we intend to solve.
